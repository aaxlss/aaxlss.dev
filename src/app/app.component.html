          As a Full Stack developer, I specialize in both back-end and front-end
          development, with a focus on building and enhancing mobile
          applications for Android and React Native platforms. I am proficient
          in utilizing Git, GitHub, and Azure as software version controllers,
          while also implementing CI/CD processes through tools like Jenkins and
          Azure.
          <br />
          I prioritize quality through unit testing, employing JUnit and
          PHPUnit. Collaborating closely with various departments, including
          cross-location teams, Quality Control, and fellow developers, I ensure
          streamlined internal processes and efficient task completion.
          Additionally, I take pride in my role as a mentor, providing training
          and guidance to new hires as well as mentoring senior and junior
          developers in their professional growth.
